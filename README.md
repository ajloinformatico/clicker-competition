### Structure: üß±

* ***Secutiry:*** üîí

    * From the security side, I have created a service in the Security package ***is.lojo.clickercompetition.demo.Security***;
    It acts as a filter using a list of roles based on the role of the player, who will be able to access one part of the application or another.
    
    ![Security](doc/img/permisos.png)
    
    * Permissions by roles are applied in the main of the application divided by routes.    
    
    ![Filter](doc/img/filtro.png)

* ***Models:*** üë§
    * The program has 6 interrelated models
        * Country : Top level has One to Many relationship with Communities.
        * AutonomousCommunity : Second level has One to Many with Player.
        * City : Third level has One to Many with Players.
        * Player: Players are at the lowest level with teams and roles.
        * Role: Last level has One to Many relationship with player.
        * Team: Has Many to Many relationship with Player.
    ![Models](doc/img/models.png)
          
* ***Services:*** üì°
    * JWTAuthorizationFilter
        * establish security by roles
    * PlayerUtilitiesService
        * Player common funccions on loigin and update
    ![PlayerService](doc/img/player-service.png)
    * ImageService 
        * Player and Teams Avatar. with default or customs images
    ![ImageService](doc/img/image-service.png)
    
* ***Controllers:*** üéõÔ∏è
  * Except for the uploading of images, which is done using multipart-form-data. The rest of the controllers 
    handle access to the treatment of all data by routes sending and receiving information via JSON. The application 
    is divided into 4 controllers. Each of them associated with an entity, the main one is login () associated with 
    playerController, depending on the player's role, they will be able to access a series of routes within the application
    ![CONTROLLERS](doc/img/controllers.png)
    ![LOGIN](doc/img/log-in)
    ![LOGOUT](doc/img/log-out.png)

* ***Data Base:*** üìÅ
    * the project started using h2, at the end of development I switched to mysql. The database configuration 
      is in **resources.application.properties**
    ![MysqlScripts](doc/img/application-properties.png)
    * the database is built from two ***docker*** containers. your file is in **docker/docker-compose.yaml**
    ![docker-myql](doc/img/docker-mysql.png)
* The scripts are at ./sql directory .
